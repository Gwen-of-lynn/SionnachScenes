## Credits and Acknolodgements
---
---

For this project I followed a tutorial from Code Institute for a Task Manager Database and adapted for my own database, styling and project needs. 

For the error pages I used and adaped code from my previous milestone project, [The Essential Oil Database]() which was based on code from [this custom error pages site](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/errorpages/).


The structure of this readme is based on [A Greave’s Picflip and Familyhub readme files](https://github.com/AJGreaves).
 
##### Special thanks to:
Aaron Sinnott, my mentor for this milestone project.
